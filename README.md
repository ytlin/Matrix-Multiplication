# Matrix-Multiplication

## Multi‐Process Matrix Multiplication using Shared Memory

* Matrix multiplication using multiple processes
  * Basic parallel processing
  * Will be faster with multicore machines
* Input: the dimension of two square matrices A & B    
  *  E.g., 100 A, B, and C are 100x100 square matrices
* Output: an execution time and a checksum
